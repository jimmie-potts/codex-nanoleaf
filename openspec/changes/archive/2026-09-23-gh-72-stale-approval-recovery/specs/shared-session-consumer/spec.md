## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Honest freshness and effect recovery
Disconnected or uncertain shared sessions SHALL keep their last colors steady with no pulses/comets while current peers retain normal behavior. A later authoritative owner revision that removes an unknown-ID approval on the same turn MAY clear that frozen blocked color while preserving uncertain evidence, assignments and effect suppression. Health and map task status evidence SHALL distinguish transport and session freshness from the displayed status. Recovery SHALL preserve epochs and assignments and SHALL NOT replay expired effects. Agents SHALL never wait on this consumer. This covers #29 disconnect and reconnect criteria and #72 approval recovery.

#### Scenario: Feed loss in Work or Free
- **WHEN** a selected shared feed is lost
- **THEN** Work retains steady last colors, notices and assignments, Free remains free of task-light writes, and health reports uncertainty without legacy fallback

#### Scenario: Restart or snapshot resync
- **WHEN** the worker starts or reconnects with a current snapshot after lost changes
- **THEN** current state replaces its projection without replaying old celebrations or restarting retained pulse epochs

#### Scenario: Owner retires one uncertain approval
- **WHEN** a later validated owner revision removes an unknown-ID approval from the same turn while that session remains uncertain
- **THEN** the consumer clears frozen blocked red, marks task status evidence uncertain, and does not pulse, replay a comet or change assignments and notices
